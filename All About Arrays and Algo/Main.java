    // Defination of Array:Continous form of data but Actually in java data store in heap memory is actually not not continous bcz objects store in heap memory is not continous
    // In Java, objects stored in heap memory are managed by a memory allocation system that dynamically allocates and deallocates memory as needed, which may result in non-contiguous memory allocation.
    // accessing elements is same as in other programming language 
    // System.out.println(name[3]);  // Output 0
